# README for Booklist-App-Javascript | No Frameworks

It is a book list app made by using JavaScript.
I have used classes, local storage, Document Object Model (DOM)

Things you can do in this are as following.
1. See the books in the local storage.
2. Create books.
3. Books will be added to booklist.
4. Delete books / Remove books.
5. Every time you add or delete a book, you will get an alert.
